# Update league start dates

When the user says **"update league dates"** or **"update league start dates"** (or equivalent), follow this workflow:

1. **Gather external data**  
   Run: `npm run gather-dates` (or `node scripts/gather-launch-dates.mjs`).  
   If env vars are missing, run anyway; the script will report which sources need `STEAM_API_KEY` / `POE_OAUTH_TOKEN`.

2. **Update `src/data/leagues.json`**  
   - Use the script output and/or any dates the user provides.  
   - Edit only the fields that need changing: `date` (required), and `event` if the event name changed.  
   - Keep `date` in **ISO 8601** with timezone: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` (e.g. `2026-02-27T07:00:00Z`).  
   - Preserve the rest of each league object (id, game, slug, accent_color, features, news, etc.).

3. **If the user gives a specific game or new date**  
   Find the league by `id` or `game` and update that league’s `date` (and `event` if relevant). Confirm the change.

Reference: external sources and script setup are documented in `docs/EXTERNAL_DATA_SOURCES.md`.
