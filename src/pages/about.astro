        Next League Start is built and run by a single developer, with occasional help from the community. Support comes from readers (for example via Buy Me a Coffee). This project is not linked to any game studio, publisher, or official gaming brand. League dates and other details are best-effort only and may be wrong or lag by up to 48 hours.
